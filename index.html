            two-fifths of
            the cDespite Canada’s great size, it is one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries.
            <br> It is next to the Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic Oceans. It is the only country in the world to be next
            to three
            oceans at once. It has six time zones.</br>

            <p>Canada is made up of ten provinces and three territories. The provinces are between the 45th and 60th
                parallels
                of latitude, and the territories are to the north of the 60th parallel of latitude. Most large cities

                                of Canada, which is a federal parliamentary system under a constitutional monarchy. The
